You are given a dataset (uploaded on Kaggle). You are required to use and train any
classifier and then make a submission.
● You would need to preprocess the data to filter out outliers, irrelevant or redundant
indices, etc.
● You may need to balance the data during training.
● You can use any technique for feature extraction.
● You may use techniques like SVM, bagging, boosting, PCA, LDA, Multilayer
Perceptron(up to 5 hidden layers), etc. These are just example techniques that can be
useful. However, You can use other models also from scikit-learn.
● There are marks for scoring (on the basis of Kaggle rankings).
● Look and review also all the instructions, data, rules carefully mentioned on the
Competition Page before starting the challenge.
Dos:
● Make end-to-end codes, i.e., given input data, output CSV should be generated. Your
code should able to generate predictions and accuracy for any given test file.
● Save your final models/weights and submit them along with the codes.
